# My dream PC build ever

My dream Pc build is not an expensive but still require good money to get good item. Back to my first year in Dipmola, I did use potato laptop that really sad. My dad buy the laptop because the seller say its i7 but it a gen 1st. Then I start my dream to build a good setup PC to fulfill my lust in gaming. 

Right now I have a Dell XPS 8940. Pretty quite good PC i7 11th gen,16gb RAM, 512gb NVME SSD + 1tb HDD and intel UHD 750 as a graphic display. I had buy cheap graphic card RTX 3050 battle ax and replace from 500w PSU to 650w. Suddenly in 3 days it broken after a day of heavy gaming. Two times Dell XPS 8940 been broken. Before this PSU failure, now at the time CPU failure. Fortunately, the XPS 8940 is under warranty. Dell customer service is super great but the product is tell the different.

I want to sell this XPS to build new rig. For casing I will choose Tecware VXR around RM269.
