# About Me

Hello my name is Ahmad Afif Bin Ahmad Fairoze. I was born in 2001. I live in Ampang. I currently doing Diploma in Science Computer and Mathematics. My course bascily teaching about programming and computer. I love computer very much because I do gaming and computer can be a workstation but programming? I love it when the code working properly and no errors. My favourite hobby is gaming. My fav game is War Thunder which is the largest free-to-play multiplayer online game featuring military vehicles. I love to play War Thunder because I can drive Leopard 2a6. I used to play football or futsal but after the Movement Control Order a.k.a PKP, I start to losing my stamina, skill, fitness and no motivation to running. I am Real Madrid Fans. Hala Madrid.
